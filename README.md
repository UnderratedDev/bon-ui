## Frontend UI
A framework with declarative syntax for developing UI for web apps

## :heavy_check_mark: Features
- **Component-based**: you can build your own reusable components or use built-in.
- **Declarative syntax**: with Frontend UI it is very easy to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Declarative syntax helps you to navigate in code and to easily understand what it does.
- **States system**: each component has it's own state. When you update the state, the reconciler will automaticly update the DOM.
- **Components from the box**
- **Easy** to learn
