### Declarative syntax
With Bon UI it is very easy to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Declarative syntax helps you to navigate in code and to easily understand what it does.

### States system
Each component has it's own state. When you update the state, the reconciler will automaticly update the DOM.
